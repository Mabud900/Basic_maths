1) Fundamental Operations
*) Modulo(%): N%10 yeilds the last(least significant) digit of a non-negative integer N.
*) Integer Division(/): N=N/10 removes the last digit from N.

2) Extraction order
*) This direct approach extracts digits in reverse (from least to most significant).
*) Exmaple: N=7789 produces the sequence 9,8,7,7.

3) Why reverse?
Because the algorithm always picks the last digit first, then strips it off.

4) Coverting to forward order
You can restore the original digit one by one of:
(1) stack LIFO: Push each extracted digit,then pop to print in original order.
(2) Array/vector+ Reverse: Store digits in a container,then iterate it backward.
(3) String Conversion: to_String(N) gives a string of digits in forward order.

5) Handling Edge cases
*) Zero: The loop while(N>0) never executes. Handle N==0 seperately
*) Negative numbers: Take absolute value or handle the '_' sign explicitely.
*) Floating-Point Numbers: %10 and integer division are invalid. Use string-based parsing if needed.
